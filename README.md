# Osmosis Contract List

This repository contains a list of all approved code IDs to Osmosis, 
along with metadata about their instatiations that web clients can more easily use. 
Once some standardization around the needed data is achieved, 
this should eventually migrate to be on-chain.

The goal is that since Osmosis governance approves every contract instantiation, 
wallets and explorers should be able to display human readable names for contracts,
rather than opaque addresses.

Such a list should doubly serve to give folks a quick sense of what contracts already exist on Osmosis today.
